// Bumped to 27: claude-haiku-4.5 copilot store rows now price correctly (alias added) — #1093.
// Previously the raw id 'claude-haiku-4.5' (tier-first, dot) from session-store.db had no
// pricing alias, so days finalized with this model were stuck at $0. No self-heal via prefix
// fallback exists for this id, so a version bump is required to force re-derivation.
// Bumped to 26: copilot input/cache tokens for sessions covered by the CLI's
// session-store.db move from one shutdown-rollup lump (stamped at session end)
// to per-request DB rows with real timestamps, supplementary accounting calls
// (rollups, residuals, paired rows) stop counting as api/model calls, and
// reasoning tokens leave the copilot cost recompute (they are inside the
// output the per-turn calls already bill). Per-day attribution, call counts and
// costs all move, so days finalized under an earlier version would disagree
// with the live parse.
//
// Why 26 and not 21 (the number this change first claimed): 20 is #1040 (codex
// model attribution), 18 was burned by an earlier public head of THIS change
// under different accounting, and 21-25 landed on main while this branch was in
// validation — 25 in particular was spent by #1056 (`codex-auto-review`
// pricing) after this PR had already minted it, which is why the number moves
// again here. 26 is the first free number on main's ladder — and it is load
// bearing beyond the collision: the branch's own validators already hold
// daily-cache.v21.json files whose copilot slices were carried stale by the
// bug PENDING_REDERIVE_PROVIDER_VERSIONS fixes below, and only a number those files
// cannot claim gets them re-derived. isMigratableCache/adoptOlderDailyCaches
// carry a same-or-newer version forward as FINALIZED without re-deriving it,
// so a number can never mean two accountings. (feat/core-extraction also sits
// at 26 and reconciles at its final merge by keeping the max.)
//
// Bumped to 25: `codex-auto-review` now prices as the recommended GPT-5.5
// row (#1047). Days already finalized under v24 keep that id at $0
// forever unless MIN_SUPPORTED_VERSION moves: the daily cache has no
// per-provider invalidation. The Codex parse version and CODEX_CACHE_VERSION
// move with this so the lower caches reprice first; this pass then re-derives
// ALL days from the warm session cache (seconds, not a full re-parse).
// adoptOlderDailyCaches keeps the superseded file as the baseline. v21 is
// #946, v22 was this PR's earlier claim, v23 is #1075, v24 is #1090.
//
// Bumped to 20: the Codex fast-path read a nested
// `base_instructions.provenance.model` out of `session_meta` as if it were
// `payload.model` (#1040), so every call a rollout attributed from session
// metadata - the ones before its first `turn_context`, and every one after a
// mid-file `session_meta` - was credited to the wrong model. The codex parse
// version and CODEX_CACHE_VERSION move with it, but the daily cache has no
// per-provider invalidation, so days already finalized keep the wrong model
// rows forever unless MIN_SUPPORTED_VERSION moves too. This pass re-derives
// ALL days for EVERY provider off the warm session cache, so it costs seconds
// rather than a full re-parse, and it is lossless: adoptOlderDailyCaches keeps
// the superseded v19 file as the baseline, and the partial-survival guard from
// #1033 holds any day whose sources have only partly aged out. On a real
// 110-day cache the 19 -> 20 pass moved ZERO days down and lost none: 100 days
// came back byte-identical and 9 grok days rose by $19.80 in total, clearing
// rollups the grok parse change had left stale, while every codex model row
// stayed identical (that corpus predates the `provenance` field, so the fix it
// carries has nothing to correct there).
//
// Bumped to 19: Grok authoritative usage now keeps one session-level rollup
// from top-level totals, clamps reasoning to reported output, and labels mixed
// authoritative/heuristic coverage. Every day finalized under the previous
// accounting carries the old Grok totals, and the daily cache has no
// per-provider invalidation, so raising MIN_SUPPORTED_VERSION is the only
// lever: it forces a one-time re-derivation of ALL days, for every provider,
// not just Grok. That pass reads the warm session cache (CACHE_VERSION is
// unchanged and only PROVIDER_PARSE_VERSIONS.grok moved), so it costs seconds
// rather than a full re-parse, and adoptOlderDailyCaches keeps the superseded
// file as the baseline for days no source can still re-derive. Days whose
// sources only PARTLY survive are held by the partial-survival guard in
// mergeDayEntries, which is what makes a global re-derive safe to force: on a
// real 108-day cache the 17 -> 19 pass moves Grok cost and tokens and nothing
// else - the day-by-day call counts come back identical.
//
// The shipped predecessor is v17; v18 was an unreleased draft of this change
// and only exists in pre-release checkouts. 19 clears both.
//
// Bumped to 17: copilot CLI sessions were misclassified as VS Code transcripts
// (#944), so days finalized at v16 or earlier carry output-only copilot costs —
// the session.shutdown rollup's input/cache tokens were dropped. Raising
// MIN_SUPPORTED_VERSION forces the one-time re-derivation under the
// provenance-based classification; sourceless days carry forward as-is.
//
// v16: Codex discovery is structural instead of originator-gated
// (#873/#626), so rollouts written by third-party frontends driving
// `codex app-server` ("t3code_desktop", "JetBrains.IntelliJ IDEA", ...) now
// contribute usage that v15 rollups never contained. Those files were rejected
// before they were ever parsed, so nothing downstream can notice on its own:
// `usage-aggregator` serves every day before today from this cache, and
// retention is ten years, so an upgrading user with a warm cache would keep the
// pre-fix history forever while today's numbers silently disagreed with it.
// Raising MIN_SUPPORTED_VERSION forces the one-time re-derivation.
//
// v15: per-project daily rollups. Days and provider slices now carry
// a `projects` breakdown (cost/calls/savings/sessions per project) so project
// history outlives the session files, like models and categories already do.
// This bump is the first to ride the v14 carry-forward: the old cache is
// adopted losslessly and only days whose sources survive are re-derived (now
// with projects); days already sourceless keep their totals and simply have
// no project split.
//
// v14: NEVER-LOSE history. Session files are ephemeral (Claude Code
// deletes transcripts after ~30 days), so a day that can no longer be re-derived
// from sources exists ONLY in this cache. Every earlier version treated the
// cache as disposable — schema bumps, savings-config changes, timezone changes
// and incomplete-hydration retries all dropped the days and re-derived from
// whatever sources survived, silently truncating history to the source-retention
// window (five bumps between 2026-06-22 and 2026-07-16 erased everything before
// 2026-04-24 on a machine with usage since March). From v14 on, invalidation
// re-derives what it can and CARRIES FORWARD every (day, provider) slice it
// cannot, and loading a missing/unsupported cache file adopts days from every
// older daily-cache file in the cache dir instead of starting empty. Bumping
// the version now only forces re-derivation of days whose sources still exist;
// it must never again lose the rest. DailyEntry.providers slices carry a full
// per-provider breakdown (tokens, models, categories) so those carry-forwards
// stay exact across rebuilds.
//
// v13: day bucketing is now TURN-anchored (a turn's whole cost/calls
// land on the day of its user-message timestamp) to match the live headline/
// report rollup. v12 bucketed each call by its own timestamp, so a midnight-
// straddling turn split across two days and history.daily / the provider
// breakdown never reconciled to current.cost. Raising MIN_SUPPORTED_VERSION
// forces the one-time re-hydration that rebuilds history under turn bucketing.
//
// v12: CodeWhale support adds historical usage that earlier rollups
// did not contain. Both the CodeWhale branch and the kiro credit-pricing
// change (below) claimed v11 independently, so v12 is the first version that
// contains both; raising MIN_SUPPORTED_VERSION forces the one-time
// re-hydration for days finalized at either v11.
//
// v11: kiro cost accounting changed (metered credits pass through
// the session cache instead of being re-priced from estimated tokens), so
// days finalized at v10 carry token-estimated kiro costs that were off by up
// to 16× per model. Raising MIN_SUPPORTED_VERSION forces the one-time full
// re-hydration that backfills history under credit-based pricing.
//
// v10: cursor accounting changed (real composer context tokens on
// conversation-anchored records, Cursor-published composer pricing), so days
// finalized at v9 carry the old double-counted agentKv estimates and
// sonnet-proxy composer costs.
//
// v9: providers added since the v8 rollup (Grok, Hermes, ZCode) parse usage
// that older binaries skipped. v8 added local-model savings to the daily
// rollup; the `savingsConfigHash` field is invalidated separately when the
// user changes their `localModelSavings` mapping.
// v23: codex pricing fix (#1075) - reasoning tokens were billed on top of
// output (they are a subset of it) and cache_write_input_tokens was ignored, so
// days finalized at v20 carry codex costs overstated by ~3.5% and codex output
// tokens overstated by ~34.6%. Raising MIN_SUPPORTED_VERSION forces the
// one-time re-derivation.
// It takes 23, not 21: v21 is claimed by the #946 landing branch and v22 by
// PR #1056, so those numbers are spoken for and reusing one would let two
// incompatible schemas share a filename. (feat/core-extraction sits at 26 and
// reconciles at its final merge by keeping the max.)
//
// v24: gpt-5.6-codex / gpt-5.6-codex-max pricing (#1077) - added as explicit
// litellm-snapshot.json rows. getModelCosts already resolved both ids to the
// correct rate via the `gpt-5.6` prefix fallback before this landed, so a day
// finalized on any binary that had a `gpt-5.6` snapshot row already carries
// the right cost; this bump only matters for a day finalized before THAT (a
// window where neither existed). The daily cache has no per-provider
// invalidation, so there is no way to tell those days apart from here -
// raising MIN_SUPPORTED_VERSION forces the one-time re-derivation for
// everyone, which is a lossless no-op for days already correct.
// v25: #1047 activity-id pricing. v24 on main already shipped #1090.
// v26: #946 copilot session-store accounting (see the top of this ladder).
// v27: #1093 claude-haiku-4.5 alias (see top).
// v28: #1115 report/optimize output tokens go through billableOutputTokens.
// Exclusive providers (Grok and the rest) were under-counted by reasoningTokens
// in finalized daily rows; inclusive {claude,codex,copilot} were correct there
// but optimize added reasoning again. Re-derive so report matches the live parse.
// v29: #1118 OrcaRouter route pricing (fusion aliases + peel; auto stays unpriced).
// v28 on main already shipped #1115.
// v31: Hermes cost provenance. Subscription-included sessions stay $0,
// explicit estimates retain their status, and surviving Hermes sources replace
// v29 slices produced by the old API-equivalent fallback.
// 31: #1234 Hermes cost contract; 30 is claimed by #1132.

/// PARTIAL SURVIVAL (the v14 never-lose contract, extended past all-or-nothing).

/// NOTHING there. But transcripts age out per FILE, not per day: Claude Code
/// deletes them after ~30 days, and turn-anchored bucketing means a handful of
/// turns from surviving later files still land on a mostly-aged-out day. The
/// fresh slice is then non-empty but truncated, and replacing the baseline with
/// it silently deletes the rest (measured on a real cache upgrading 17 -> 19:
/// 2026-07-16 fell from $1,685.17 / 12,530 calls to $385.44 / 560 calls).
///
/// So a fresh slice replaces a settled baseline slice only when it carries at
/// least as many CALLS — the same or more evidence. Fewer calls means the
/// source set demonstrably lost data, and the baseline is kept whole.
///
/// Why calls and not sessions: session counts shrink routinely on days whose
/// sources are entirely intact (a session's turns re-attribute to a neighbouring
/// day), measured at 1-5 sessions on recent days whose call counts were
/// identical across the re-derivation. A sessions test would freeze stale slices
/// on healthy days. Why not cost/tokens: those are re-priced accounting on the
/// same evidence — exactly what a legitimate re-derivation changes (#1015 Grok
/// keeps its per-day calls and raises cost, and is unaffected by this guard).
///
/// Why no source-set test instead: a day entry records no source files, counts
/// or fingerprints, and the session cache is keyed by file rather than by day,
/// so "were this day's sources all present?" cannot be answered from the cache.
/// The calls comparison is the available proxy.
///
/// TRADE-OFF: a future fix that legitimately REDUCES calls on a settled day
/// (deduplication) is blocked, and that day keeps the older, higher value until
/// its slice is re-derived under an equal-or-greater call count. That is the
/// "estimate high, never lose" direction v14 already chose over silent loss.
///
/// Recent days stay authoritative: within the settle window their session files
/// are still on disk, so a shrink there is a real change (the user deleted a
