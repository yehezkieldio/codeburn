// v6: per-turn `prRefs` capture for turn-level PR spend attribution. Existing
// cache turns carry no prRefs; bumping forces a one-time re-parse so surviving
// transcripts populate the field. (Daily-cache versioning is untouched.)
// v7: sidechain->parent linkage - per-turn `spawnToolUseIds`, per-file
// `parentSessionId` / `agentSpawnLinks` - so subagent spend folds into the parent
// turn's PR set. v6 never shipped, so users cross v5->v7 in a single combined bump.

// below) to EVERY prior version that can still exist on disk, or expired-PR
// history from the immediately preceding build silently vanishes.
// v8: on-disk layout only - the single blob became a directory of per-provider
// shards plus a small envelope, so a launch that only touched one provider
// rewrites just that provider's file. The turn shape is unchanged, so a v7 file
// migrates losslessly (migrateSingleFileCache) rather than re-parsing.
// v9: on-disk layout only - a provider's shard split further by the UTC month of
// each cached file, so one appended session rewrites one month instead of the
// provider's whole (100MB-scale) history, and a ranged query loads only the

// final turn) the entry never invalidates. Mid-session turns self-heal since
// append-only transcripts keep changing. Fixing this properly means

// ── Status Snapshot ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `codeburn status --format menubar-json` is spawned as a fresh CLI process
// on every menubar poll tick, so every in-process reuse layer above
// (`cacheMemo`, and `parser.ts`'s TTL/burst maps) starts cold on every poll —
// none of them survive between invocations. Live profiling of a repeat poll
// against an already-warm, unchanged ~386MB session cache showed the cost is
// dominated by re-running `JSON.parse` on that whole file plus re-running the
// full aggregation pipeline over it, every single time, even when nothing in
// the underlying session corpus changed.
//
// This snapshot persists the last computed menubar payload keyed by a
// caller-supplied corpus fingerprint (see `computeCorpusFingerprint` in
// parser.ts — a cheap stat-only pass over every discovered source, with no
// session-cache.json read/parse and no transcript content read) plus the
// resolved query that produced it. A poll whose corpus fingerprint and query
// both still match is served straight from this tiny file with no corpus
// parse or aggregation at all; the instant either changes, the lookup misses
// and the caller recomputes for real. Best-effort throughout: any read/write
// failure just falls back to a full recompute, never to stale or corrupt
// data.

// Debounce: once the corpus fingerprint moves, keep serving the last SETTLED
// snapshot until this record's first observed mismatch has aged past the
// window, instead of recomputing on every single poll of a burst. A streaming
// assistant turn
// can touch its transcript many times a second; without this, a menubar
// polling on a tight interval would pay the full parse+aggregation cost on
// every one of those ticks. The deferred call deliberately does NOT persist
// a new snapshot — the pre-churn baseline it's still serving stays on disk —
// so the first poll after the mismatch clock ages past the window sees a real
// fingerprint mismatch with no fresh grace period left,
// recomputes for real, and persists the settled result. No update is ever
// masked permanently: the window only ever delays picking one up. Mirrors
// the existing `parseBurstWindowMs`/`CODEBURN_PARSE_BURST_MS` convention:
// small, capped, env-overridable for tuning/tests.
